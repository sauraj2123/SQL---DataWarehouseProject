DDL Script: Create Gold Views (PostgreSQL)
===============================================================================
What this script does:
    Builds the gold layer as a star schema using views:
      - gold.dim_customers  (dimension)
      - gold.dim_products   (dimension)
      - gold.fact_sales     (fact)
    The views join and rename silver data so it is ready for reporting.
    Query them directly, e.g. SELECT * FROM gold.fact_sales;
===============================================================================
*/

-- Drop the fact view first because it depends on the two dimension views

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS gold.dim_customers;
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS gold.dim_products;
